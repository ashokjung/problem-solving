# Graph

- Graphs are non linear DataStructure 
- Represents a Complex relationship 
    - Connected Cities , Friends on Social Media
    - Graph consists of Node , Entities or Vertices 
    - This where the data is stored 
    - Edges connect the vertices or Nodes or Entities 
- Trees are the special Graph , All Trees are Graph vice versa is    not true 
- Trees are simpler as Graph can have cycles. 
- Graph is Cyclic or Acyclic Graph.  
- Directed Graph defines a clear path 
    - Example in a directed graph you can go from A-> B , B->C but B,<- A is not allowed similarly C<-B is not allowed , may be a different path is possible
- Un Directed Graph you can traverse freely in either direction freely.
- All Tree are directed Graph and Acyclic in nature 
- Graph can be Directed or Un Directed , Cycling or Acycling. 
- Tree has Parent and children 
- Graph has Nodes ,Edges Vertices or Entities 
- Weight of the edge is associated it called Weighted Graph 
- In case Weight is not assigned its called UnWeighted Graph. 
- Connectivity 
    - Connected if each elements are connected and has a relationship it is called Connected Graph if One or few elements are not connected then its called Disconnected Graph. 

- Types of Graph 
    - Cyclic    / Acyclic 
    - Directed  / Undirected 
    - Weighted  / UnWeighted 
    - Connected / Disconnected
- Reachability and Stronly Connected Graphs or Strongly Connected Components 
- Sparse or Dense Graph 
- Bi Partix & Degree of Graph


- When using DFS 
    - We would need a visited array or a set 
    - Use stack for the traversal or recursion Last in First out.sss

- When using BFS 
    - We would need a visited array or a set 
    - Use Queue for the traversal First in First out
