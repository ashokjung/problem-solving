Write a function which takes a list of integers

representing points on a graph, and returns the positions which are local maxima.



Note: Wording of 'function' and 'graph' can be confusing, consider "write code which takes a list of integers, representing x values in a function, and returns a list of positions which are local maxima" if appropriate.



If the candidate struggles to understand, e.g. does not know ‘maxima’, use an example:
```
[1,2,3,5,7,11,11,12,10,8,5,3,11,12,15,10,7,2,2]
```
If the solution is too fast or simplistic, use one with edge cases e.g. plateaus, trailing peak:
```
[5,1,2,3,5,7,11,11,12,12,10,5,3,11,12,12,15,10,7,2,2,17]
```
